 Artificial Intelligence (AI) extends human capabilities, using machine learning through supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Itâ€™s categorized into Weak AI (specific tasks), Strong AI (general capabilities), and Super AI (human-level consciousness). Generative AI creates content (text, images, audio, video) and is used in marketing, healthcare, gaming, and more. AI benefits include smart assistants, personalized recommendations, enhanced security, and content creation. Generative AI tools include models like GPT and DALL-E, used for text, image, and voice generation. AI chatbots improve customer service, offering 24/7, scalable, and personalized responses. AI impacts industries like manufacturing, healthcare, finance, and retail, driving efficiency and innovation.
 Module 2 focuses on machine learning which is a subset of AI and it uses algorithms to make decisions from data. It includes supervised learning (labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns), and reinforcement learning (maximizing rewards). Training involves dividing data into sets. Deep learning uses neural networks for tasks like image captioning and driverless cars. Generative AI models like VAEs, GANs, and Transformers generate content. Cognitive computing mimics human reasoning, while NLP, speech-to-text, computer vision, and IoT help machines understand the world. Cloud and edge computing enable real-time applications.
 Module 3 explains AI agents which autonomously perform tasks by interacting with their environment. Robotics involves designing robots, with cobots collaborating with humans using AI and sensors. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) automates repetitive tasks. AI in business streamlines tasks like data entry and scheduling, freeing up employees for creative work. Generative AI aids in content creation, data analysis, and customer service. GANs enable high-quality content creation. Adopting AI in business includes goal-setting, identifying use cases, and monitoring systems. AI tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Tableau boost productivity, with careers for AI ethicists, product managers, and strategists.
 Module 4 gives us an understanding of ethical considerations and responsible AI use that AI ethics ensure fair, beneficial, and human-rights-respecting development. Key issues include data privacy, bias, transparency, human oversight, and equality. Responsible use involves diverse datasets, accessibility, and energy efficiency. Generative AI poses challenges like copyright and deepfakes. Companies like IBM, Microsoft, and Google promote ethical AI with fairness, transparency, and human-in-the-loop systems. AI governance, such as the EU AI Act, ensures responsible development. Risks like bias, privacy violations, and model deterioration require continuous monitoring and updates for effective governance.
